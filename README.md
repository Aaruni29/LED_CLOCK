## Digital Clock with 7-Segment Displays
Namaste! Welcome to the repository for a simple yet elegant digital clock project built around classic 7-segment LED displays. Inspired by the timeless charm of road-side dhabas, railway clocks, and school exam bells, this digital clock design is a perfect blend of nostalgia and engineering finesse. This project is specially designed with care and precision, keeping in mind the joy of both making and learning.

At the heart of this system lies a beautifully laid out custom PCB, which handles the task of driving multiple segments with grace. The schematic layout, filled with digital ICs, current-limiting resistors, and well-routed tracks, reflects the love and care poured into traditional Indian engineering jugaad, but with the discipline of modern CAD tools. In the second image, you can appreciate the vibrant layout of the PCB, complete with ICs labeled and traces dancing their way to connect segments seamlessly.

The backside of the PCB is no less interesting it proudly carries a “Hack Club” mascot and is adorned with five capacitive touch buttons labeled "Hours", "Minutes", "Mode", "Set", and "Color". These allow you to set and customize the clock experience without physical wear-and-tear. It’s an ode to both modern UX and traditional practicality.

Powering the entire circuit is a microcontroller based system with carefully routed power supply sections. Each of the 7-segment digits is driven by a separate IC module, and together they orchestrate the display of time in HH:MM format. The schematic, shown in the last image, is a complete manifestation of modular design philosophy. The top portion of the schematic deals with the brain and power management, while the bottom rows contain a field of driver ICs and segment connections that form the heart of this visual symphony.

All in all, this is more than a clock—it is a tribute to every Indian student who looked up at the school wall clock counting down exam minutes, every train traveler who relied on platform digits, and every maker who found joy in blinking LEDs.
